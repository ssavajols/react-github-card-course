### Controlled components

Controlled components are components that are controlled by react to render data.

Inputs can be controlled by react with the `state` attibutes and the state of the component can't differ from his `DOM` representation.

If we bind the input value to a `state` property, the input value can only be updated by the component state update.

If we bind the input value to a `props` property, the value can't be updated.

```jsx
class MyControlledComponent extends React.Component {

  ...

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      search: event.currentTarget.value
    });
  }

  render() {
    return <form onSubmit={this.onSearch}>
      <input type="text"
          placeholder="Search"
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          value={this.state.search}
          required />
      <input type="submit" value="Search" />
    </form>;
  }
}
```

### Uncontrolled components

Uncontrolled components are components where the `state` can diverge from the `DOM` representation.

Like inputs with no value attribute setted. The user can interact and change the input value without updating the component `state`.

```jsx
class MyUncontrolledComponent extends React.Component {

  ...

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      search: event.currentTarget.value
    });
  }

  render() {
    return <form onSubmit={this.onSearch}>
      <input type="text"
          placeholder="Search"
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          required />
      <input type="submit" value="Search" />
    </form>;
  }
}
```

### Ref and typescript casting

To access to an `HTML` element we can use `ref` attribute on React components. All `ref` attributes of the component are referenced to `this.refs` property.

With typescript we have to cast to the correct `HTMLElement` type like `HTMLInputElement` for the value attribute of an input.

It makes it easier to get `DOM` access with react.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  ...

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      search: (this.refs.username as HTMLInputElement).value
    });
  }

  render() {
    return  <input type="text"
          ref="username"
          placeholder="Search" />;
  }
}
```
